! 1. 8 digits of accuracy.

! 2. 16 digits of accuracy.
It is consistent - the standard provides 15-17
significant decimal digits.

? 3. 4 terms are needed for the current precision
level
! It is 3 terms, because the 4th is too small to contribute

! 4. The number of terms required in the approximation,
increases with |x|.

? 5. NaN is generated at x = 0, where sin(x) = 0.
This results in 0 / 0 => NaN.
Check if x = 0 and skip the iteration if so.
The point is undefined, so no point in adding it
to the plot.

! Could do the above. Better:
! sinx / x ~= x / x = 1 as x -> 0
! If x = 0, sinc = 1
