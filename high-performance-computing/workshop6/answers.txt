1) I changed the line
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
To
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16

2) The first 8 threads to finish run on compute node 1, the second 8 threads
to finish run on compute node 2.

^ Coincidence?
First 8 processes on node 1, second 8 on node 2.

16 processes in total on 2 compute nodes.

3)
Set the number of nodes:
#SBATCH --nodes=2
Set the number of processes:
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=16
16 * 2 = 32

4) 4 MPI processes, 8 OpenMP threads for each MPI process.
These run on two compute nodes. Each compute node runs 2 MPI processes.
So 32 OpenMP threads.

Correct (First page of answer is wrong: "8 openmp threads per node")

5) Set --ntasks-per-node 8, --cpus-per-task 2.
