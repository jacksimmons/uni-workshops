1) End time: 45(s)
Advection: 0.45(m)

2) The end time increases 100x (45 to 4500s)
This is because dt is proportional to the inverse of NX (number of grid pts)
As dt is 100x larger as NX is 100x smaller, it follows that the end time
will also be 100x larger than before (as the number of time steps doesn't
change).

3) The accuracy has decreased - on the green curve the amplitude has
decreased noticably from what it should be.
The curves are "truncated" at the top due to the decreased accuracy.

4) The reduced resolution makes the program execute 100x fewer calculations.
This is a large computational time save in the advection calculation part.

5) It skews the scale of the graph. It seems it does this by adding anomaly
points at very extreme u values, making the original points all but
disappear.

6) The values of u are all inf/-inf in final.dat.

7) Use an if-statement to apply the correct stencil programmatically.
